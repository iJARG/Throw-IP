# Throw-IP

Page with register, login and recover password, you can automatically modify the style of the page to black, blue and white.
You have a database made in php and MySQL, I recommend using "xampp" to create the database.
When you are already logged in, you will enter the home page that is empty, and you can go to a booter panel to pull internet connections (IPStresser API).


The page can be modified to your liking but always leaving credits.
